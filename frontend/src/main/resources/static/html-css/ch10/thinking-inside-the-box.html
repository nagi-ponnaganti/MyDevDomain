<h1>The Cottage Garden</h1>
<p>The <i>cottage garden</i> is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design, dense plantings, and a mixture
    of ornamental and edible plants.</p>
<p>The Cottage Garden originated in <a href="">England</a> and its history can be traced back for centuries, although
    they were re-invented in 1870's England, when stylized versions were formed as a reaction to the more structured and
    rigorously maintained <a href="">English estate gardens</a>.</p>
<p>The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants, with an emphasis on vegetables and
    herbs, along with some fruit trees.</p>
